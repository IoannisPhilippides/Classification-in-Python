    "# Simple Nearest Neighbours document classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will write a program that can classify documents into any number of classes, based on provided training data. There are many classification algorithms; we will look at one of the simplest possible methods, that still often turns out to work quite well in practice: the *nearest neighbour classifier*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is as follows:\n",
    "1. We define a distance function between documents. The distance between two documents that are equal is zero. The more different the documents are, the larger the distance.\n",
    "2. Given a new document that we want to classify, we calculate the distance between it and *all* documents in the training data. One of them will be closest according to the distance measure we defined above. We report the class of the closest match as the predicted class for the new document.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can test your program on the spam dataset that is provided via blackboard. We provide lots of hints as to how to process your data and how to set up your distance function; but some parts of the design will be yours to choose."
